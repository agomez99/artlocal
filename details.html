                <p>Since the forming of the duo in 2014, Los Otros Murals has continued to use their artwork to aid local organizations in raising money to fund important missions. To date, they have raised over 40K for Child Advocates San Antonio, American Indians in Texas of the Spanish Colonial Missions, and a number of other local non-profits throughout San Antonio.
                  Their creative ways of raising awareness and funds  also spans across education and cultural staples. Los Otros has designed clothing in collaboration with New Era to bring awareness to Hispanic Heritage month. This project has been ongoing since 2017 and now benefits 27 universities across the US with half of the proceeds going back into the arts programming of each school.
                  The duo has also helped cultural staples in San Antonio, TX like FIESTA™ San Antonio. In 2019 Los Otros were the first artists commissioned to create artwork to represent one of the largest festivals in the nation. Fiesta San Antonio is a two week long event that brings in 3.5 million visitors who’s proceeds benefit over 150 local non profits.
                  Los Otros also plays a major part within the San Antonio public art scene as a partner of the San Antonio Street Art Initiative (SASAI). SASAI is a non-profit, 501c3, that aids in the introduction, education, and growth of public art within the street art mural genre and advocates for the  careers of practicing SASAI artists.</p>
